The last couple of months at Fullstack have been a blast, and I am looking for a job and a company that will help me keep that sense of excitement and passion for coding! Besides all of that, I like oysters, craft beer, and dogs. Originally from Atlanta, I went to Boston for college and have remained there ever since.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ADBuchanan6","messages":[],"profile_picture":{"crops":{"_200x200":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/PhV3cg3tSbWQEkoydeZQ"},"original":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/a6px5FA3SJ2giAsHCqVG"},"visited_profiles":[{"_id":"53b598b771d4b50e0049a0d4"},{"_id":"53b81deed923330800f049dc"},{"_id":"53b95bd871ecf3080087951a"},{"_id":"53b9691071ecf30800879532"},{"_id":"53b96c5f71ecf3080087955a"},{"_id":"53b96c6471ecf3080087955c"},{"_id":"53ba9f279d239e0800f622e9"},{"user_id":"53397d94ddfc8c0800c5ca49","name":"Hannah Jane Buchanan","organization":"Fullstack Academy","time_visited":"2014-07-08T18:45:08.695Z","_id":"53bc3c351265b90800d97cc7"},{"user_id":"53397d94ddfc8c0800c5ca49","name":"Hannah Jane Buchanan","organization":"Fullstack Academy","time_visited":"2014-07-08T22:48:03.044Z","_id":"53bc7523b4ca9b08003245d6"},{"user_id":"53b223660db03e08008336cf","name":"Stav Meidan","organization":"Fullstack Academy","time_visited":"2014-07-09T02:31:06.871Z","_id":"53bca96bb4ca9b0800324605"},{"user_id":"53bd936b2dca3408000df779","name":"Tiffany Bogich","organization":"The Coaching Fellowship","time_visited":"2014-07-09T19:31:43.042Z","_id":"53bd989f2dca3408000df7ba"}],"profiles_visited":[{"_id":"53b2e8eaf84725080003a470"},{"_id":"53b5792aeb66f8080093f3dc"},{"_id":"53b80227ed4338080034ee50"},{"_id":"53b80521ed4338080034ee51"},{"_id":"53b809b9ed4338080034ee53"},{"_id":"53baabf89d239e0800f622f0"},{"_id":"53bb1484765fdf0800513779"},{"user_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46a","name":"Alex Buchanan","organization":"PwC","time_visited":"2014-07-08T23:02:14.354Z","_id":"53bc7875b4ca9b08003245eb"},{"user_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46a","name":"Alex Buchanan","organization":"PwC","time_visited":"2014-07-09T13:54:32.909Z","_id":"53bd49982dca3408000df766"},{"user_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46a","name":"Alex Buchanan","organization":"PwC","time_visited":"2014-07-09T13:59:26.376Z","_id":"53bd4abd2dca3408000df767"},{"user_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46a","name":"Alex Buchanan","organization":"PwC","time_visited":"2014-07-09T14:01:47.158Z","_id":"53bd4b4a2dca3408000df768"},{"user_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46a","name":"Alex Buchanan","organization":"PwC","time_visited":"2014-07-09T14:03:29.519Z","_id":"53bd4bb02dca3408000df769"},{"user_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46a","name":"Alex Buchanan","organization":"PwC","time_visited":"2014-07-09T14:06:58.458Z","_id":"53bd4c812dca3408000df76a"},{"user_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46a","name":"Alex Buchanan","organization":"PwC","time_visited":"2014-07-09T19:37:57.803Z","_id":"53bd9a162dca3408000df7d0"}],"events":[{"_id":"53bd94962dca3408000df791","clicks":{"url":"github","time_clicked":"2014-07-09T19:14:30.142Z"},"visited_by":{"id":"53bd936b2dca3408000df779","name":"Tiffany Bogich","organization":"The Coaching Fellowship","time_visited":"2014-07-09T19:14:30.142Z"}},{"_id":"53bd96cc2dca3408000df7a0","clicks":{"url":"github","time_clicked":"2014-07-09T19:23:56.724Z"},"visited_by":{"id":"53bd936b2dca3408000df779","name":"Tiffany Bogich","organization":"The Coaching Fellowship","time_visited":"2014-07-09T19:23:56.724Z"}}],"auth_methods":[{"provider":"linkedin","providerId":"8XvjPKKUmh","_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46b"}],"projects":[{"name":"TwitterSphere","url":"http://twitter-sockets.herokuapp.com/","githubUrl":"https://github.com/buchanaf/twitterSocketIo","pitch":"A real-time, interactive display for Tweets and Instagram photos","tech_tags":"Angular, Node.js, Socket.io, Express, and D3.js","description":"Used socket.io to create real-time tweet streaming, hashtag counts, and a D3.js visualizations of geolocation.","role":"Developer","_id":"53b80946ed4338080034ee52","image":{"original":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/fl3Gq7xCTkCwJmgfoU6F","crops":{"_150x150":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/vroLTyvuSva9BmfKRKFc"}},"tags":[]},{"name":"SnipSnap","githubUrl":"https://github.com/buchanaf/CodeSearch-1","pitch":"Find code snippits for Node.js libraries and basic JavaScript methods.","tech_tags":"AngularJS, Node.js, MongoDB, Esprima, Cheerio, Express","description":"We built a web-crawler to search GitHub repositories to find relevant JavaScript files that we then pushed into our database.

The documents are parsed on the front-end using an angular factory which heavily incorporates Esprima and Async libraries. After the documents have been parsed, the individual code snippets, along with the source code, are displayed on the front-end using directives, filters, and modals (as well as highlight.js) to allow for the users to easily browse the results. Individual snippets also have an associated score that users can vote for after they log into GitHub.","role":"Fullstack Developer","_id":"53bd4f3d2dca3408000df76c","tags":[]}],"work_experiences":[{"company":{"id":1044,"industry":"Accounting","name":"PwC","size":"10,001+ employees","type":"Partnership"},"id":245637881,"isCurrent":false,"title":"Associate","_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46f","endDate":{"month":3,"year":2014},"startDate":{"month":9,"year":2011}},{"company":{"id":46798,"industry":"Marketing and Advertising","name":"Leader Enterprises","size":"51-200 employees","type":"Privately Held"},"id":245645217,"isCurrent":false,"title":"Operations and Finance Intern","_id":"53b2e876f84725080003a46e","endDate":{"month":8,"year":2009},"startDate":{"month":5,"year":2009}}],"educations":[{"fieldOfStudy":"Web Development","id":225028032,"notes":"Full-time, immersive software engineering course on full-stack web development with a focus on the Javascript MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express/Node.js & Angular.js.
